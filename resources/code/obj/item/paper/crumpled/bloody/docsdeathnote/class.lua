    No one's coming to help, that much has become clear.<br>
    Sure, it's lonely, but do I have much choice? At least I brought the analyzer with me, they shouldn't be able to find me without it.<br>
    Who knows who's waiting for me out there. Its either die out there in their hands, or die a slower, slightly more comfortable death in here.<br>
    Everyday I can feel myself slipping away more and more, both physically and mentally. Who knows what happens now...<br>
    Heh, so it's true then, this must be the inescapable path of all great minds... so be it then.<br>

    <i>Choose a room, and enter the sphere<br>
    Lay your head to rest, it soon becomes clear<br>
    There's always more room around every bend<br>
    Not all that's countable has an end...<i>]],
