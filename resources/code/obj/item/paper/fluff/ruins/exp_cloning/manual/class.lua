	Congratulations, you are testing the H-11 experimental cloning device!<br>
	Using the H-11 is almost as simple as brain surgery! Simply insert the target humanoid into the scanning chamber and select the clone option to initiate cloning!<br>
	<b>That's all there is to it!</b><br>
	<i>Notice, cloning system cannot scan inorganic life or small primates.  Scan may fail if subject has suffered extreme brain damage.</i><br>
	<p>The provided CLONEPOD SYSTEM will produce the desired clone.  Standard clone maturation times are roughly 90 seconds.
	The cloning pod may be unlocked early after initial maturation is complete.</p><br>
	<i>Please note that resulting clones will have a DEVELOPMENTAL DEFECT as a result of genetic drift. We hope to reduce this through further testing.<br>
	Clones may also experience memory loss and radical changes in personality as a result of the cloning process.</i><br>
