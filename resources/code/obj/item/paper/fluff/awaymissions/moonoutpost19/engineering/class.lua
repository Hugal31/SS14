We've stolen this stuff from Nanotrasen, so all the equipment is jury-rigged. We have generators that work on both plasma and uranium, about 50 sheets should power the outpost for quite a while. If the generators aren't working, which is very likely, take the power cell on the desk and put it into the APC in the hallway. That should get the place running, at least for a little while.",
