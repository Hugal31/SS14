    info = "Researcher: <u>Dr. Sakuma Sano    </u><br>Date: <u>03/06/2554</u><br><br>Report:<br>When the larva first emerged from the chest of the monkey, it seemed very curious. It would wander around aimlessly for awhile and then sit still. We are unable to determine the gender of the larva, or even determine if it has a gender. After some time had passed, it seemed to lose interest in its surroundings and sat mostly still while occasionally wagging its tail. We decided to throw in a live mouse to see if it would consume it. The larva quickly attacked and ate the mouse and seemed to get larger very suddenly, this suggests that the larvae are capable of metabolizing and directing all the energy towards growth at previously thought impossible speeds. It is a shame that we cannot observe the process more closely, as we do not currently know how dangerous or violent this creature is or will become as it matures fully.<br><br>It is tempting to imagine the possibilities of utilizing such a mechanism. The capability of skipping years of growth time for children, repairing bodily damage in a matter of moments, even its usage in existing cloning technology.",
