    info = [[<i>I swear to fulfill, to the best of my ability and judgment, this covenant:
	<br>
	I will respect the hard-won scientific gains of those physicians in whose steps I walk,
	and gladly share such knowledge as is mine with those who are to follow.
	<br>
	I will apply, for the benefit of the sick, all measures that are required,
	avoiding those twin traps of overtreatment and therapeutic nihilism.
	<br>
	I will remember that there is art to medicine as well as science,
	and that warmth, sympathy, and understanding may outweigh the surgeon's knife or the chemist's drug.
	<br>
	I will not be ashamed to say "I know not,"
	nor will I fail to call in my colleagues when the skills of another are needed for a patient's recovery.
	<br>
	I will respect the privacy of my patients, for their problems are not disclosed to me that the world may know. Most especially must I tread with care in matters of life and death.
	If it is given me to save a life, all thanks. But it may also be within my power to take a life;
	this awesome responsibility must be faced with great humbleness and awareness of my own frailty. Above all, I must not play at God.
	<br>
	I will remember that I do not treat a fever chart, a cancerous growth, but a sick human being, whose illness may affect the person's family and economic stability.
	My responsibility includes these related problems, if I am to care adequately for the sick.
	<br>
	I will prevent disease whenever I can, for prevention is preferable to cure.
	<br>
	I will remember that I remain a member of society, with special obligations to all my fellow human beings,
	those sound of mind and body as well as the infirm.
	<br>
	If I do not violate this oath, may I enjoy life and art, respected while I live and remembered with affection thereafter.
	May I always act so as to preserve the finest traditions of my calling and may I long experience the joy of healing those who seek my help.
