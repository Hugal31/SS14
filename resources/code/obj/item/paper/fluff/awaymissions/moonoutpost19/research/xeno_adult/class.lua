The snake-like larva has molted into a 7 foot tall insectoid nightmare in just a few hours. It's obvious now as to why such heavy duty containment was needed. It immediately tried to escape however by flinging itself at the window in a flurry of swipes and stabs. It seems its behavior has returned to a state that is very similar to the facehugger, though I doubt with the same intent! Thankfully, our glass and shields have shown to be more than sturdy enough for such a violent creature, and so far, any attempts at the creature escaping have been in vain.<br><br>As for its physiology, the creature has an elongated head with what appears to be have an exoskeleton resembling an external rib-cage on the torso. The alien is also fairly skinny with a lean body. The little amount of meat on the alien appears to be entirely muscle.  We assume this makes it deceptively strong, while remaining agile at the same time.  One of the most interesting things we have seen is its pharyngeal jaw.  It has some what of an inner mouth capable of being fired externally at extremely high speeds. It has already caused many dents in the walls and a few small cracks in the window with it. The alien also has a couple of dorsal tubes on its back, their purpose unknown. Finally, this monster sports a long ridged tail, complete with a large and extremely sharp blade at the tip.<br><br>Normally I would be absolutely terrified of something like this, but I'm putting my trust in Nanotrasen with the containment. After all, they wouldn't build a cell that could fail to contain its subject, would they?",
