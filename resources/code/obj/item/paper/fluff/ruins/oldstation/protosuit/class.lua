Based off of a recovered pre-void war era united Earth government powered military exosuit, the RIG Hardsuit is a breakthrough in Hardsuit technology, and is the first post-void war era Hardsuit that can be safely used by an operator.<br><br>The B01 however suffers a myriad of constraints. It is slow and bulky to move around, it lacks any significant armor plating against direct attacks and its internal heads up display is unfinished,  resulting in the user being unable to see long distances.<br><br>The B01 is unlikely to see any form of mass production, but will serve as a base for future Hardsuit developments.",
