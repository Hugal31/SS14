While feeding them our last monkey subject and throwing out the box, the aliens merely looked at us instead of infecting the monkey right away. They looked to be collectively distressed as they would no longer be given hosts, where instead we would move to the next phase of the experiment. When I glanced at the gas tanks and piping leading to their cell, I looked back to see all of them were up against the glass, even the queen! It was as if they all understood what was going to happen, even though we knew only the queen had the cognitive capability to do so.<br><br>The only explanation for this is a form of communication between the aliens, but we have seen no such action take place anywhere in the cell until now. We also know that regular drone and hunter xenomorphs have no personality or instinct to survive by themselves. Perhaps the queen has a direct link to them? A form of a commander or overseer that controls their every move? A hivemind?",
