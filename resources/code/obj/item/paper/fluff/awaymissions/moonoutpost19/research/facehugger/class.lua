    info = "Researcher: <u>Dr. Sakuma Sano    </u><br>Date: <u>03/06/2554</u><br><br>Report:<br>The test subject we were provided with truly is alien. It is a small spider-like creature with bony legs leading to a smooth body. It has a long tail connected to it, and it has shown extremely aggressive behavior by flinging its entire body at the glass and shields to no avail. While doing so, we noticed there was a small pink hole in the middle of the body.<br><br>When we sent in a monkey through the crude but effective disposal tube, the alien immediately jumped at its face and latched on. The monkey was quickly suffocated by its constricting tail, unable to pry off the fingers. The monkey at first seemed to be dead, but was observed to be breathing. The recently named alien 'facehugger' fell off dead and curled its legs up like a spider moments after it had finished with the monkey's body.<br><br>While the monkey appeared to be unharmed, we kept it in the cell for a couple more hours until we were horrified to discover it screaming out in pain as a snake-like creature erupted from the monkey's chest! It appears that the 'facehugger' is only the start of this life cycle. The impregnation cycle involving the creatures growing inside the chests of their hosts seems to only be the beginning.",
