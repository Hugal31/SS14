It is quite clear that the facehuggers are not selective in their hosts, and so far the gestation process has been shown to have a 100% success rate.<br><br>The larvae themselves have been behaving very differently from the lone larva we first observed, and despite shying away from humans they are clearly comfortable with others of their kind. Our previous suspicions on larvae have been confirmed with their demonstration of playfulness: they are not nearly as aggressive or violent when young, before molting to adulthood.<br><br>The majority of the play we observed involved a sort of hide-and-seek, and occasionally wrestling by tangling themselves and struggling out of it. While normally we would write these off as instinctual play for honing their skills when they molt, their growth period is so incredibly fast and they are still such adept killers that it would serve no practical purpose. The only explanation for this is perhaps to create bonds and friendships with each other, if that is even possible for such an incredibly hostile race. It may be that they are much more reasonable with each other than other life forms.<br><br>It had become clear that now was the best time to extract a xenomorph for dissecting, as these were all still larvae and the queen was still attached to its ovipositor and would be immobile. With the approval of the research director, we sent in our medical robot that had been dubbed 'Head Surgeon' into the containment pen, dropping the shields for only a fraction of a second to allow it entry. The larvae were cautious, but the curiosity of one had him within grabbing range of our robot. It was brought out and quickly euthanized through lethal injection, courtesy of our mechanical doctor.",
