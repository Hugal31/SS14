# SS14

*Yet another ridiculous attempt to clone Space Station 13*.

## How to start

Export the environment variable `SS13_SOURCE` containing the path the [TGStation source code](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation).
Then, simply run `cargo run`. You may append the path to a map file (.dmm) to load it.
