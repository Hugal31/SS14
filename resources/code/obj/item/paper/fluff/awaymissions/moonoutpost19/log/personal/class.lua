This bloody gateway keeps desyncing itself, and that means subsisting off recycled water and carb packs. No clue where the damn thing connects to on its off days, and HQ say we are 'not to touch it if it isn't linking to command.' We dumped off the assload of crates Jim filled, got our boxes of oxygen, food and drink, and closed the portal.<br><br>Log 2:<br>Damn thing is acting up again. Three days no contact this time. I thought I heard clanking noises from it yesterday. Jim is going on about the NT base or some shit. We've been over this before - They don't know we're here, that engineer was too drunk to recognize his suit, especially since I had it painted orange. He's starting to get annoying. We're safe.<br><br>Log 3:<br>Gateway synced itself up automatically today. I opened it for an instant to spy through it, got a glimpse of the inside of a transport container. Either HQ's redecorating or something, or there's more than two of these things.",
