    info = "Researcher: <u>Dr. Mark Douglas    </u><br>Date: <u>06/06/2554</u><br><br>Report:<br>While observing the growing number of aliens in the containment cell, we began to notice subtle differences that were consistently repeating. Like ants, these creatures clearly have different specialized variations that determine their roles in the hive. We have dubbed the three currently observed castes as Hunters, Drones, and Sentinels.<br><br>Hunters have been observed to be by far the most aggressive and agile of the three, constantly running on every surface and frequently swiping at the windows. They are also remarkably good at camouflaging themselves in darkness and on their resin structures, appearing almost invisible to the unwary observer. They are always the first to reach the monkeys we send in leading us to believe that this caste is primarily used for finding and retrieving hosts.<br><br>Drones on the other hand are much more docile and seem more shy by comparison, though not any less aggressive than the other castes. They have been observed to have a much wider head and lack dorsal tubes. They have shown to be less agile and visibly more fragile than any other caste. The drone however has never been observed to interact with the monkeys directly and instead preferring maintenance of the hive by building walls of resin and moving eggs around the nest. As far as we know, we have only ever observed a drone become a queen, and we have no way of knowing if the other castes have that capability.<br><br>Lastly, we have the Sentinels, which appear at first glance to be the guards of the hive.  They have so far been only observed to remain near the queen and the eggs, frequently curled up against the walls. We have only observed one instance where they have interacted with a monkey who strayed too closely to the queen, and was pounced and held down immediately until it was applied with a facehugger. Their lack of movement makes it difficult to determine their exact purpose as guards, sentries, or other role.",
