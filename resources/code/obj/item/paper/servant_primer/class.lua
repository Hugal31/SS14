The crew can't get here normally.</li><li>In the north is your base camp, with supplies, consoles, and the Ark. In the south is an inaccessible area that the crew can walk between once they arrive (more on that later.) Everything between that space is an open area.</li><li>Your job as a servant is to build fortifications and defenses to protect the Ark and your base once the Ark activates. You can do this however you like, but work with your allies and coordinate your efforts.</li><li>Once the Ark activates, the station will be alerted. Portals to Reebe will open up in nearly every room. When they take these portals, the crewmembers will arrive in the area that you can't access, but can get through it freely - whereas you can't. Treat this as the \"spawn\" of the crew and defend it accordingly.</li></ol><hr>Here is the layout of Reebe, from left to right:<ul><li><b>Dressing Room:</b> Contains clothing, a dresser, and a mirror. There are spare slabs and absconders here.</li><li><b>Listening Station:</b> Contains intercoms, a telecomms relay, and a list of frequencies.</li><li><b>Ark Chamber:</b> Houses the Ark.</li><li><b>Observation Room:</b> Contains five camera observers. These can be used to watch the station through its cameras, as well as to teleport down to most areas. To do this, use the Warp action while hovering over the tile you want to warp to.</li><li><b>Infirmary:</b> Contains sleepers and basic medical supplies for superficial wounds. The sleepers can consume Vitality to heal any occupants. This room is generally more useful during the preparation phase; when defending the Ark, scripture is more useful.</li></ul><hr><h2>Things that have changed:</h2><ul>CLOCKCULTCHANGELOG</ul><hr><b>Good luck!</b>]],
