    info = "Entry One - 27/05/2554:<br>I just arrived, and already I hate my job. I'm stuck on this shithole of an outpost, trying to avoid these damn eggheads running all over the place preparing for god knows what. There's no crimes to stop, no syndies to kill, and I'm not even allowed to beat the fuckin' assistant senseless! They said I was transferred from Space Station 13 for 'good behavior', but this feels more like a punishment than a reward. All I know is that if I don't get some action soon, I'm going to go insane.<br><br>Entry Two - 03/06/2554:<br>Okay, so get this: we got a fuckin' deathsquad coming in today! I thought the day I saw one of them would be the day my employment was 'terminated', if you get my drift. They're escorting some sort of weird alien creature for the eggheads to study. I heard one of the docs telling the chef that this thing killed a whole security force before it was captured. I sure as hell hope that I don't have to fight it.<br><br>Entry Three - 08/06/2554:<br>My first real bit of 'action' today, if you could call it that. Crazy Ivan got in a fight with Kuester today about his Booze-O-Mat. Apparently one of the crewmembers had stolen a couple bottles of booze from the machine after Ivan disabled the ID lock. Tell you the truth, I don't blame the thief. Everyone is going a little stir-crazy in here, and the bartender is being damn stingy with the alcohol. Either way, once they started to pick a fight, I had to take them down. It's a damn shame that we don't have a brig, though. I had to lock Ivan in a fuckin' freezer, for god's sake. Let's hope that we can keep our sanity together, at least for a while.<br><br>Entry Four - 10/06/2554:<br>Jesus fucking Christ riding on a motorbike. These things the scientists are studying are terrifying! Fucking great huge purple bug things as tall as the ceiling, with blades for arms and drooling at the mouth. I don't think my taser will do jack shit against these damn things, but the eggheads say that they're safely contained. If they do, I have a feeling that it's only a matter of time before we're all screwed. These bastards look like walking death.<br><br>Entry Five - 18/06/2554:<br>Finally caught who stole the booze from Kuester. It was that fuckin' loser assistant Steve! He was in the dorms, chugging his worries away. I took one of the bottles back to the barkeep, but no one has to know about this second one. I think I'm gonna enjoy this while watching tomorrow's Thunderdome match.<br><br>Entry Six - 19/06/2554:<br>Oh, great. The chef is still sleeping, so we get Ivan's gruel for breakfast today. I overheard Sano and Douglas saying something about the aliens being restless, so we might get some action today. As long as it happens after the big game, I'm fine with it. I still got one beer to drink before I'm ready to die.",
