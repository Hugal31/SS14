But here's some<BR>\ninstructions on how to operate things here.<BR>\nYou can grow plants and each iteration they become<BR>\nstronger, more potent and have better yield, if you<BR>\nknow which ones to pick. Use your botanist's analyzer<BR>\nfor that. You can turn harvested plants into seeds<BR>\nat the seed extractor, and replant them for better stuff!<BR>\nSometimes if the weed level gets high in the tray<BR>\nmutations into different mushroom or weed species have<BR>\nbeen witnessed. On the rare occasion even weeds mutate!<BR>\n<BR>\nEither way, have fun!<BR>\n<BR>\nBest regards,<BR>\nBilly Bob Johnson.<BR>\n<BR>\nPS.<BR>\nHere's a few tips:<BR>\nIn nettles, potency = damage<BR>\nIn amanitas, potency = deadliness + side effect<BR>\nIn Liberty caps, potency = drug power + effect<BR>\nIn chilies, potency = heat<BR>\n<B>Nutrients keep mushrooms alive!</B><BR>\n<B>Water keeps weeds such as nettles alive!</B><BR>\n<B>All other plants need both.</B>]],
