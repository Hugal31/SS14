    info = "Researcher: <u>Dr. Sakuma Sano    </u><br>Date: <u>08/06/2554</u><br><br>Report:<br>The xenomorphs we have come to study here are a remarkable species. They are almost universally aggressive across all castes, showing no remorse or guilt or pause before or after acts of violence. They appear to be a species entirely designed to kill. Oddly enough, even their method of reproduction is a brutal two-for-one method of birthing a new xenomorph and killing its host.<br><br>The lone xenomorph we studied only five days ago showed little sign of intelligence. Only a simple drone that flung itself at the safety glass and shields repeatedly and thankfully without success. Once the drone molted into a queen, it became much more calm and calculating, merely looking at us and waiting while building its nest. As the hive grew in size and in numbers, so too did the intelligence of the common hunter and drone. We are still researching how they can communicate with one another and the relationship between the different castes and the queen. We will continue to update our research as we learn more about the species.",
